significant impacts on the calcium and bone metabolism and is the most likely cause for space osteoporosis1,10800873 BACKGROUND: Dietary calcium deficiency may be a risk factor for osteoporosis1,"11214558  Calcium is a very important element in the treatment of Osteoporosis, because it is the only one that acts in the mineralization phase"1,"11683549  Reduced supplies of calcium are associated with a reduced bone mass and osteoporosis, whereas a chronic and severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia, a metabolic bone disease characterized by a decreased mineralization of bone"1,"11683549  In 1998, the expert committee of the European Community in the Report on Osteoporosis-Action on prevention, has given the recommended daily dietary allowances (RDA) for calcium at all stage of life"1,"11683549  Evidence supports routine supplementation for these people at risk of osteoporosis, by providing a daily intake of 700-800 mg of calcium and 400-800 IU of vitamin D"1,"12207375  Similarly, dental caries and osteoporosis can be considered to be in vivo dissolution of calcium phosphates"1,"12207375  Similarly, dental caries and

potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D1,"12962249  Calcium consumption and exercise affect bone mass, and both may be the most significant factors in preventing osteoporosis"1,"14670550  In addition, as osteoporosis has garnered more attention there should be more attention than ever placed on the potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D"1,"15222134  Several risk factors are known in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, first of all the lack of sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake, age, genetic factors, and circumstances known to predispose falling"1,"15222134  The quantity of bone can hardly be influenced after the 35th year of age, thus prevention of osteoporosis has special significance: appropriate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, weight-bearing sports and physical activity can prevent fractures"1,"15861036  Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis from a 3-year study comparing calcitriol versus calcium for prevention of vertebral fractures were

large-scale studies evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis-related fractures in postmenopausal women are reviewed1,21289325  Postmenopausal women should continue calcium supplementation to reduce osteoporosis risk1,21310303  The purpose of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that calcium from vegetable sources is associated with osteoporosis risk and bone mineral density in postmenopausal Korean women with osteoporosis and age-matched controls (N = 144)1,"21310303  However, in this population of low-dairy consumers, intake of calcium from meat and dairy products was not related to risk of osteoporosis and bone mineral density"1,"21310303  Our results suggest that high dietary intake of calcium, especially plant calcium, reduces the risk of osteoporosis and increased bone mineral density in postmenopausal Korean women"1,"21956827  Calcium/vitamin D was used by 35% of the menopausal women, none of the premenopausal women and 50% of the male patients and 18% of the menopausal women, 67% of the premenopausal women and 8% of men received no prophylaxis or treatment for osteoporosis"1,"22716221  In addition, dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, as well as weight-bearing exercise, for the preservation of bone mass and the decrease of fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, were evaluated"1,"24671370  For those consuming inadequate dietary calcium, calcium supplements have been a standard strategy for prevention of osteoporosis"1,"2577588  Calcium deficiency and reduced

osteoporosis (N = 16)1,"9536295  By controlling osteoporosis and restoring the proper calcium storage function of the bone, many diseases of old age which are due to or exacerbated by calcium deficiency and disturbed calcium distribution in the body, such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis and senile dementia, may also be successfully controlled"2,10423619  Retrospective studies in adults suggest that childhood calcium intake is associated with risk of later osteoporosis and fracture2,"10423619  In addition, common childhood clinical conditions, such as low calcium intake related to lactose intolerance or the use of glucocorticoid medications for chronic illness, are risk factors for the development of osteoporosis in childhood, not just in adulthood"2,"10423619  An approach for physicians and other pediatric care providers for screening children for low dietary calcium intake, low bone density, and other osteoporosis risk factors using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the use of calcium supplementation in clinical care are presented"2,"10477499  Our conclusion from the MIR 97 mission is that an adequate calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during space

interest"2,"3288849  Health educational programmes, which are designed to prevent osteoporosis and which identify women who are most at risk of the disease, should provide sensible nutritional advice on an adequate calcium intake and regular weight-bearing exercise among other life-style changes"2,8243426  In conclusion it can be stated that the data support the hypothesis that adequate calcium intake through milk and milk products in childhood and adolescence is a decisive marker for obtaining a maximum bone mass (peak adult bone mass) and for the prevention of osteoporosis2,"8243426  Furthermore, it can be stated that increased calcium intake in the later years may not reduce the accelerated risk of osteoporosis resulting from inadequate calcium intake during childhood and adolescence"2,"8837543 EVIDENCE: Relevant clinical studies and reports were examined, in particular those published since the 1988 Osteoporosis Society of Canada position paper on calcium nutrition"2,9659411  Calcium intake appears as an obvious nutritional factor in the prevention of osteoporosis but its contribution is still not well established particularly when populations with different habitual levels of calcium intake are compared2,"9659411  Nutritional studies demonstrate that, in general, adequate calcium intake during lifetime contributes to decrease the risk of osteoporosis"3,15767828 The underutilization of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is common among high-risk elders3,15883457  Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D4,10935417 THERAPY: Calcium and vitamin D deficits should be

effective in decreasing the occurrence of osteoporosis10,22878667  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation as an osteoporosis-prevention measure is less effective than specific antiosteoporotic treatment11,8990754  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may prevent the development of osteoporosis in high-risk individuals and are useful adjuncts when used with other treatments12,9309458  Calcium is also important later on in life to prevent bone loss and to help restore bone that might have been lost due to osteoporosis
