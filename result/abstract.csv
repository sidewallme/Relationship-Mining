0,11527053  Calcium supplements were the most commonly used osteoporosis drug0,14670550  Calcium and vitamin D in moderation also have a good safety profile and may actually have benefits far beyond osteoporosis therapy0,15861036  The efficacy of new osteoporosis therapies is often compared to calcium supplementation0,"18004026  Calcium and vitamin D are the most commonly used therapies for osteoporosis, although their efficacy in osteoporotic fracture prevention remains uncertain"1,10800873 BACKGROUND: Dietary calcium deficiency may be a risk factor for osteoporosis1,"11214558  Calcium is a very important element in the treatment of Osteoporosis, because it is the only one that acts in the mineralization phase"1,17999024  Adequate calcium with or without vitamin D significantly reduced the odds of osteoporosis but not the risk of fracture in these Caucasian women1,"17999024 CONCLUSIONS: Thus, higher calcium and vitamin D intakes significantly reduced the odds of osteoporosis but not the 3-year risk of fracture in these Caucasian women"1,21289325 PURPOSE: The most recent large-scale studies evaluating the effects of calcium supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis-related fractures in postmenopausal women are reviewed1,21289325  Postmenopausal women should continue calcium supplementation to reduce osteoporosis risk1,21310303  The purpose of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that calcium from vegetable sources is associated with osteoporosis risk and bone mineral density in postmenopausal Korean women with osteoporosis and age-matched controls (N = 144)1,"21310303  However, in this population of low-dairy consumers, intake of calcium from meat and dairy products was not related to risk of osteoporosis and bone mineral density"1,"21310303  Our results suggest that high dietary intake of calcium, especially plant calcium, reduces the risk of osteoporosis and increased bone mineral density in postmenopausal Korean women"1,"21956827  Calcium/vitamin D was used by 35% of the menopausal women, none of the premenopausal women and 50% of the male patients and 18% of the menopausal women, 67% of the premenopausal women and 8% of men received no prophylaxis or treatment for osteoporosis"1,"2577588  Calcium deficiency and reduced mobility together with unknown reasons cause type II osteoporosis, which also affects males"1,3465310  We have measured radiocalcium absorption and the fasting urinary calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios in 30 postmenopausal women receiving prednisolone therapy and compared the patients with normal spine radiographs (N = 14) with those whose spine radiographs showed osteoporosis (N = 16)1,"9536295  By controlling osteoporosis and restoring the proper calcium storage function of the bone, many diseases of old age which are due to or exacerbated by calcium deficiency and disturbed calcium distribution in the body, such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis and senile dementia, may also be successfully controlled"2,10423619  Retrospective studies in adults suggest that childhood calcium intake is associated with risk of later osteoporosis and fracture2,"10423619  In addition, common childhood clinical conditions, such as low calcium intake related to lactose intolerance or the use of glucocorticoid medications for chronic illness, are risk factors for the development of osteoporosis in childhood, not just in adulthood"2,"10423619  An approach for physicians and other pediatric care providers for screening children for low dietary calcium intake, low bone density, and other osteoporosis risk factors using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and the use of calcium supplementation in clinical care are presented"2,"10477499  Our conclusion from the MIR 97 mission is that an adequate calcium intake and vitamin D supplementation during space missions is mandatory but, in contrast to terrestrial conditions, does not efficiently counteract the development of space osteoporosis"2,"10800873  Despite advertising campaigns promoting better nutrition and increased awareness of osteoporosis, many women are failing to achieve an adequate calcium intake"2,12238730 The purpose of this study was to determine the extent and integration of osteoporosis knowledge in three age groups of women and compare knowledge to calcium intake and weight-bearing physical activity (WBPA)2,"12238730  Knowledge about osteoporosis was limited and not associated with age, WBPA or calcium intake"2,"14625125 CONCLUSIONS: Findings emphasize the need to expand education in all areas of osteoporosis health-related behaviors among ultra-orthodox women, and in calcium intake and exercise for secular women as well"2,17999024 RESULTS: Higher lifetime calcium intake was associated with reduced odds of osteoporosis (peripheral BMD T-score &lt; or =-23,15767828 The underutilization of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is common among high-risk elders3,15883457  Adequate nutrition plays a major role in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis; the micronutrients of greatest importance are calcium and vitamin D
